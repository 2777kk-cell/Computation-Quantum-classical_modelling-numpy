A naive way of turning your digital computer into a Fake Quantum computer using one of the most popular Data Science based Library "Numpy". This code works best on Jupyter-lab while it can also be used on any IDE that supports ipynb(format).

Prerequisites: Numpy

A Quantum state of a qubit can be represented mathamatically using n-dimensional  Linear Algebra. We use Orthonormal basis vectors in order to represent a logical qubits.  


| globally unique Id     | state vector        |
| -----------------------| ------------------- |
| a random guid1         |      |0>            |
| a random guid2         |      |0>            |
| a random guid3         |      |0>            |
|  .                     |                     |
